        <h1>Numerical Analysis</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the development and application of algorithms
            for solving problems involving continuous variables. This field is essential for practical computations,
            where exact solutions are often unattainable, and approximations must be employed. Numerical analysis covers
            a wide range of topics, including solving systems of linear and nonlinear equations, optimization,
            interpolation, numerical integration and differentiation, and the solution of ordinary and partial
            differential equations.

            Historically, numerical methods have been crucial for scientific and engineering advancements, enabling
            complex calculations that are infeasible by hand. With the advent of computers, the scope and impact of
            numerical analysis have expanded dramatically. Today, it underpins many applications in science,
            engineering, economics, and beyond. Modern numerical analysts work on improving the accuracy, efficiency,
            and stability of algorithms, ensuring they can handle large-scale problems and high-dimensional data.

            The discipline requires a deep understanding of both theoretical mathematics and practical implementation,
            often involving computer programming and software development. By bridging the gap between abstract
            mathematical concepts and real-world applications, numerical analysis plays a pivotal role in advancing
            technology and knowledge across diverse fields.

                Methods of Numerical Analysis

            <!-- bisection method -->
            <h5>Bisection Method</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To find the root of a function (where the function equals zero).<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> This iterative method repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the
                subinterval in which the root must lie. It continues until the interval is sufficiently small.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Simple and robust, though can be slow.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="html/bisection.html" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Newton-Raphson Method</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To find the root of a function.<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> This method uses the function's derivative to iteratively approximate the root.
                Starting with an initial guess, the method improves the guess using the formula:
                <code>x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> - (f(x<sub>n</sub>) / f'(x<sub>n</sub>))</code>.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Faster convergence than bisection but requires the derivative and a good initial
                guess.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Euler’s Method</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs).<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> This simple numerical procedure solves initial value problems by approximating
                solutions at discrete points. Starting from an initial point, it uses the slope (given by the
                differential equation) to find the next point.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Straightforward to implement, though less accurate for stiff equations or large
                step sizes.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Trapezoidal Rule</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To approximate definite integrals.<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> This method estimates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into
                trapezoids rather than rectangles and summing their areas.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Simple and more accurate than the basic rectangular rule.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Simpson’s Rule</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To approximate definite integrals.<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> It approximates the integral by fitting parabolas to segments of the curve and
                integrating these parabolas. It generally provides better accuracy than the trapezoidal rule.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Slightly more complex than the trapezoidal rule but still relatively easy to
                apply.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Linear Interpolation</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To estimate values between known data points.<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> It assumes a straight line between two adjacent data points and uses the line
                equation to estimate the value at any point between them.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Very simple and widely used for quick approximations.
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Practice</a>

            <h5>Gaussian Elimination</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> To solve systems of linear equations.<br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> This algorithm transforms the system into an upper triangular matrix, making it
                easier to solve through back substitution.<br>
                <strong>Ease:</strong> Conceptually straightforward but can be computationally intensive for large
                systems.
